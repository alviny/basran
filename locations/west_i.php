	<p>Master Dean Iacobucci, a 5th Dan Black Belt certified by the Kukkiwon, joined Cheung's Taekwondo&reg; Toronto at St. Clair Ave. in 1986. He was taught by Senior Master Tam and Grand Master Cheung in Toronto. In 1988, he started our Taekwondo program at Annette Community Centre (Toronto West). He has nurtured over 33 black belts up to 4th Degree Black Belt level. He assisted Grand Master Cheung to Guyana, Grenada and Barbados to conduct Taekwondo seminars and black belt testing in 2003. Master Iacobucci was invited to teach in Brampton at our 169 Queen Street East location by Grand Master Cheung as the Chief Instructor for 1 year in 1996-1997. He is the Chief Instructor of	our Cheung's Taekwondo&reg; Toronto West (Bloor West Village). In March, 2005 Master Iacobucci moved the Taekwondo program from Annette Recreation	Centre to a private location. St. Paul's Community Centre now houses the Bloor West Village location of Cheung's Taekwondo&reg; Toronto West. Classes operate on Tuesdays and Fridays from 6pm to 8:30pm</p>
	<p>In October 2006, Master Iacobucci started another location: the Mississauga location. Steve Madrid is assisting with this program, and working on building it to be a success. Classes operate on Saturday afternoons from 2pm to 4pm.</p>
	<p>In January 2007 Master Iacobucci started a 3rd location under the Toronto West Chapter, held at Armour Heights Community Centre. This location has students starting at the young age of 5 years old, and is quickly becoming a great place to train. Classes operate on Thursday afternoons from 4pm to 5pm.</p>
	<p>Students from all locations of Cheung's Taekwondo&reg; are welcome to visit Master Iacobucci's locations to practice, work out together, or to just drop in and say hello.</p></td>
