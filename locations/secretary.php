	<p>Master Larry McVean, 4th degree Black Belt, started his journey with Grand Master Cheung in 1978. Unfortunately, other responsibilities took priority and he was unable to continue his training. At the age of 26, he was able to resume his journey with Grand Master Cheung and Cheung's Taekwondo, as it is known today. Larry's aspirations of becoming a Black Belt were on its way. Through his hard work, commitment and dedication, he was able to achieve the level of 1st Degree Black Belt in 1990. As he continued to establish new goals, he achieved the level of Master (4th Degree Black Belt) in 2004. </p>
	
	<p>Throughout his tenor at Cheung's, he has had the privilege in assisting with the teaching program developing and supporting individuals and helping them achieve their goals. He has been known for running an intense military style class and leads extremely energetic and challenging workouts. This coupled with his ability to inspire students, he has had great success in helping individuals recognize and achieve their level of potential. Over the years, Larry has challenged himself on many occasions both physically and mentally. </p>
	
	<p>One of his most memorable experiences was breaking 5 concrete slabs along side Grand Master Cheung who stacked 9 concrete slabs during one of our demonstrations at an Inner Club. He could never have imagined been given the honor to participate in a demonstration with an individual who has been a tremendous influence and inspiration in his life. Aside from his wife and two wonderful children, he dedicates part of his success, both in his personal life and professional career to Grand Master Cheung.</p>
