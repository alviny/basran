	<p>Yousef Barghi is a 2nd Dan Black Belt. He started training in Cheung's Taekwondo® Brampton on May, 2002.  Before attending Cheung's Taekwondo® Yousef had practiced karate for about three to four months however after that he didn't practice any other style of the martial arts, until he started Taekwondo.   </p>

	<p>Yousef's goal in Taekwondo is to be the best that he can be, and to become a master some time in the near future. He plans on training very hard in order to place first in many championship tournaments either representing Cheung's Taekwondo®, Canada, or his home country Iran. </p>

	<p>His favorite Poomsae in Taekwondo would probably have to be "Koryo", and his favorite foot technique is "jump tornado roundhouse". His favorite combination whenever he is doing paddle kicking is "Jump Tornado Roundhouse, Spinning Heel Kick, Sliding Roundhouse, and shuffle back, Sliding Round House Spinning Heal".  He likes this combination because he himself had made up this combination drill during a teaching class. His favorite breaking techniques are punch and roundhouse kick. Whenever he is sparring, he likes to use butterflies in order to attack his opponent and jump back in order to counter his opponents attack. </p>

	<p>Yousef likes to spend his time playing different kinds of sports; however his favorite sport is basketball. Yousef's favorite subject in school is Physical Education, and his best subject is Mathematics.</p>
