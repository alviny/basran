<ol>
	<li>Beginning of the round:  when you called “Chung” and “Hong”, you must point the fi</li>
	<li>This distance allows you to be able to “Kal-yeo” - break up the contestants by taking 2 steps forward.</li>
	<li>This distance allows you to be great control of the contestants during the match.</li>
	<li>If you are drawn farther away than 1.5 meters, you will start losing the control and the ability to step in to break up the contestants as soon as required.</li>
	<li>Taking more than 2 steps to break up the contestants allow unnecessary fouls or KO to happen.</li>
	<li>In order to keep this distance, you have to be totally aware of the movements of the contestants at all times.</li>
	<li>Your awareness will be the best if you focus (or put your mind) to the center of the contestants.</li>
	<li>You cannot predetermine where the contestants are going to go.</li>
	<li>You have to flow with the contestants and your stance is very light as if you are sparring.</li>
	<li>You have to become part of the fight in order to sense and react the best of your ability – in another words, there are 3 people engaging in the match.</li>
	<li>Keep your distance not closer than 1.5 meters or you might be knocked out by a spinning heel kick which happened in world championships, a female International Referee walked into one contestant’s spinning heel kick and got knock out.</li>
	<li>After you deliver “Kal-yeo”, take your time to see if you need to switch to the opposite position to declare “Shi-jak”.</li>
	<li>If the contestants are closed to the boundary line, you need to position yourself on the other side of the boundary line facing the ring to guide the contestant back to spar in the ring.</li>
