<a name="cent"></a><div align="center"><h2><u>Center Refereeing</u></h2></div>
<ol>
	<li>The starting position of the center referee is 1.5 meters away from the center point of the two contestants.</li>
	<li>This distance allows you to be able to "Kal-yeo" - break up the contestants by taking 2 steps forward.</li>
	<li>This distance allows you to be great control of the contestants during the match.</li>
	<li>If you are drawn farther away than 1.5 meters, you will start losing the control and the ability to step in to break up the contestants as soon as required.</li>
	<li>Taking more than 2 steps to break up the contestants allow unnecessary fouls or KO to happen.</li>
	<li>In order to keep this distance, you have to be totally aware of the movements of the contestants at all times.</li>
	<li>Your awareness will be the best if you focus (or put your mind) to the center of the contestants.</li>
	<li>You cannot predetermine where the contestants are going to go.</li>
	<li>You have to flow with the contestants and your stance is very light as if you are sparring.</li>
	<li>You have to become part of the fight in order to sense and react the best of your ability – in another words, there are 3 people engaging in the match.</li>
	<li>Keep your distance not closer than 1.5 meters or you might be knocked out by a spinning heel kick which happened in world championships, a female International Referee walked into one contestant's spinning heel kick and got knock out.</li>
	<li>After you deliver "Kal-yeo", take your time to see if you need to switch to the opposite position to declare "Shi-jak".</li>
	<li>If the contestants are closed to the boundary line, you need to position yourself on the other side of the boundary line facing the ring to guide the contestant back to spar in the ring.</li>

<ol>
	<li>Mirror (Front & Side View) – a great tool and friend to help improve your movements.
	<ol type="a"><li>Front View:  face yourself directly in front of the mirror. 
	<li>Front View: you can see if your shoulder is square.</li>
	<li>Front View:  you can see if your stances are wide enough and where you knees are point at.</li>
	<li>Front View:  you can see where your finger or palm is aiming at.  Center of you or line up to the shoulder.</li> 
	<li>Front View:  develop a looking forward than a looking down habit.</li>
	<li>Side View:  looking at your posture, stances and arm position facing parallel to the mirror.</li>
	<li>Side View:  how is your front stance look like such as: knee at a 90 degrees angle on a front stance on "Joon-bi"?</li>
	<li>Side View:  with facing your left side towards the mirror, how is your walking front stance look like when you execute "Kal-yeo" and "Kye-sok"?  Your front knee should be straight, weight forward on the front knee and your upper body upright. </li>
	<li>Side View:  with facing your left side towards the mirror, you can see if your left hand is in a slightly clenched position.</li>
	<li>Side View:  with facing your left side towards the mirror, you can check if your right arm is fully extended.</li>
	<li>Side View:  you need to look to your left at the mirror throughout the whole time you execute any movement.</li>
	<li>Side View:  do not look forward executing "Kal-yeo" and then look to your left and check your stance for example!  You need to see your body in motion from the beginning to the end!</li>
	<li>Side View:  you can see you angle of your right arm when you execute "Chung" or "Hong".</li>
	<li>Side View:  you can see if your arm is straight up when you execute "Gam-jeom".</li>
	<li>Side View:  you can see if your right leg is bent enough when you execute "Shi-jak".</li></ol></li>
	<li>Angle of your arm when you execute "Chung" or "Hong" - a slightly more than a 90 degrees angle.</li>
	<li>"Shi-jak" – your stance should be low enough that you are feeling a burning sensation on your right thigh.</li>
	<li>"Gam-jeom" – you should feel that your right arm is going straight up BEHIND your ear so that your arm don't look pointing in an angle forward.</li>
	<li>Counting – always start every count from the exterior side of your shoulder bone.</li>
	<li>Counting - you should count towards the center of your body (aiming at your throat).  After you finish counting "5", bent your right arm and line it to your right shoulder.  When you count "6", your left arm shall extend towards the center (aiming at your throat).  You should find that your left arm is now in front of your right palm (holding the 5 fingers apart).</li>
